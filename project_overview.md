•	What is your data?

o	US Pollution Data: https://www.kaggle.com/sogun3/uspollution/downloads/uspollution.zip
o	Climate Change data (global land temperature) https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data/downloads/GlobalLandTemperatures.zip

•	Who are your users?

o	Environmental Activists and Climate change advocates.
o	This project can serve as an eye opener to people denying climate change (like the president-elect :/ ).
o	Activists working against the utility companies denying adverse impact of pollutants on climate.

•	What questions are users asking?

o	How does average land temperature map across the globe?
o	Which are the hottest countries in the world?
o	What is the trend of temperature change over the years? Is global warming real?
o	What are the state wise mean for the various pollutants ( NOx, O3, CO) in US?
o	What is the trend in amount of pollutants over the year?
o	Does the pollutant trend adhere to the temperature rise trend?

•	What are the use cases (user-system interactions) to answer their questions?

o	Mapping the average temperature on a globe.
o	Bar plot of countries according to the average temperature.
o	Plot showing the average global land temperature over the years.
o	Plot showing the average land temperature of each continent over the years.
o	Scatter plots of mean pollutant value over the years and across US states.
o	Plots showing state wise change in pollutant gases.
o	Plot relating temperature & mean pollutant value.

•	What issues are there ("known unknowns") with building your system?

o	Visualization tool to create state wise plots for the pollutants.
o	Visualization tool for creating a dynamic globe showing temperature of the countries.
