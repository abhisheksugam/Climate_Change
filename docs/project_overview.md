#CSE 599 B1 Project

##Visualization of Climate change & its correlation with pollution

###Abhishek Sugam | Yuanqi Mao | Giovanni Sinapi

•	What is your data?

- US Pollution Data: https://www.kaggle.com/sogun3/uspollution/downloads/uspollution.zip
- Climate Change data (global land temperature) https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data/downloads/GlobalLandTemperatures.zip

•	Who are your users?

- Environmental Activists and Climate change advocates.
- This project can serve as an eye opener to people denying climate change (like the president-elect :/ ).
- Activists working against the utility companies denying adverse impact of pollutants on climate.

•	What questions are users asking?

- How does average land temperature map across the globe?
- Which are the hottest countries in the world?
- What is the trend of temperature change over the years? Is global warming real?
- What are the state wise mean for the various pollutants ( NOx, O3, CO) in US?
- What is the trend in amount of pollutants over the year?
- Does the pollutant trend adhere to the temperature rise trend?

•	What are the use cases (user-system interactions) to answer their questions?

- Mapping the average temperature on a globe.
- Bar plot of countries according to the average temperature.
- Plot showing the average global land temperature over the years.
- Plot showing the average land temperature of each continent over the years.
- Scatter plots of mean pollutant value over the years and across US states.
- Plots showing state wise change in pollutant gases.
- Plot relating temperature & mean pollutant value.

•	What issues are there ("known unknowns") with building your system?

- Visualization tool to create state wise plots for the pollutants.
- Visualization tool for creating a dynamic globe showing temperature of the countries.
